# MLFC_project-BG-HFW_TVG

Project on Boltzmann Generatorsfor the Machine Learning for Chemistry Course 22/23. Repository uses the code of the 2019 Boltzmann Generator project of the CS230 course at Stanford as the base, which is included in the repository in the folder original_CS230_code.

The project folder contains the relevant python code used to perform the research. The notebook folder contains worked out exanmples of analyses of potential energy surfaces using Boltzmann generator and the training process.

The network structure is included in the folder networks under project. The potentials for the different analysed systems is included in the models folder under project. The methods used to sample from the potential energy surfaces directly are under sampling_techniques.
